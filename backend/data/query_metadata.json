A North-South division over slavery culminated in the American Civil War.\n* **20th and 21st Centuries:** The US emerged as a major global power, becoming a superpower after World War II and engaging in the Cold War with the Soviet Union.

Common short names include \"United States,\" \"U.S.,\" and \"USA.\"  \"The States\" is a colloquial shortening, particularly used internationally.  \"America\" is sometimes used, but this can be ambiguous as it also refers to the continents of North and South America.\n\n\nThe provided text gives a good overview of the USA, but some details (like specific economic figures) are estimates and may vary slightly depending on the source and year.
